        <p1>
            The mission of Neuroscience Alliance at UCF is to promote awareness, 
            research, and opportunities in neuroscience at UCF. By encouraging professional relations between students and faculty, 
            students will be provided with opportunities and exposure in current research, potential career paths, and provided with advice and information for a future career in neuroscience. 
            These goals shall be achieved through providing meetings and speeches related to neuroscience, potential outreach in the form of shadowing neuroscience related professionals, 
            volunteering at schools, hospitals, or other such facilities, and creating committees involving projects and ideas relevant to neuroscience within any area such as medicine, 
            philosophy, psychology, biotechnology, psychiatry, computer science, chemistry, cognitive science, linguistics, mathematics, engineering, and physics.
